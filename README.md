I am keen in solving the problems whenever something goes incorrect, because solving the problem was very fascinating until we are finding the results which requires more analysis. So I applied the same principles in software Development field also, because if any failure in the application, as a developer we have to analyse where it was failing, why it was failing, how to resolve which will be very interesting to find out the defects causing reason and fixes. A good developer work is building code as well analyzing the code, finding the issue, and fixing the defect with in the stipulated time which makes me to work as a software developer.
